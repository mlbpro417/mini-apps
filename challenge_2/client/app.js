/*For basic requirements, data-entry of the JSON on the client should be done using an HTML form with a single 
textarea input field (for the entire JSON text) and a submit button. 
When the user clicks submit, POST the form data to the server.


A single page app means that once the page loads, no user-generated actions on the page may cause the entire page to reload. 
One way this rule could be broken in your implementation is through the use of an HTML form for submitting your JSON data. 
You will know the page is reloading if you see a change in your URL. You must prevent this behavior from occurring.
